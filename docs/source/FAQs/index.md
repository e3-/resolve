**Diagnosing Infeasibilities**

Some solvers can help users diagnose infeasibilities in their model. We are aware of that 
feature in Gurobi, CPLEX, and XPRESS. If `Resolve` runs into an infeasibility and
the solver is able to identify the infeasibility, sometimes called Irreducible Infeasible Set (IIS), 
`Resolve` will save the infeasibility in the run's report folder (e.g., Gurobi will produce a text file 
with a `.ilp` file extension).
