# 2023 CPUC IRP PSP

`Resolve` is used in the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) 
Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) proceeding. Materials related to the 
2023 cycle of this proceeding can be found [on the CPUC website](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-power-procurement/long-term-procurement-planning/2022-irp-cycle-events-and-materials).

## Updated Generation Profiles

Since the [2019 CPUC IRP Preferred System Plan](./cec_epc_19_056.md), Resolve now uses 
generation profiles developed by the CPUC's Energy Resource Modeling (ERM) team, 
increasing the weather years represented from 2007-09 (2008, -09, -11 for hydro) to 
1998-2020 weather years for all generation profiles.
