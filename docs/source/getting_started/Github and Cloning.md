# Github

- `Resolve` uses a combination of Excel spreadsheets, Jupyter notebooks, and Python scripts. 
- [Github](https://github.com) helps in maintaining, operating and structuring these file types so that the model can work 
seamlessly.
- The latest release of `Resolve` can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/e3-/resolve/releases/latest)
- You can use a python or anaconda package or software like PyCharm (Recommended by E3) that enables you to clone the repository
- What is Cloning?
  - Cloning in GitHub means making a copy of a repository (a project or codebase) from GitHub to your local computer. 
  - This lets you work on the project locally, with all the files and history from the original repository.
  - Further instructions on cloning and github can be found here:
