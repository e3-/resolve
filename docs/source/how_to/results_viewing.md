# Results Viewers

## Spreadsheet Results Viewer

RESOLVE includes a refreshed Excel Results Viewer. The goal of the updated Results Viewer was to streamline results 
reporting formulas while maintaining key results reporting capabilities. As part of this 
streamlining process, the `Portfolio Analytics` tab of previous Results Viewers has been 
removed, so "raw" results reported in CSV format from the RESOLVE code are directly calculated into 
various tables on the `Dashboard` tab

Similar to the updated Scenario Tool, the new Results Viewer uses `xlwings` for its core file operations.

### Setup Instructions

As with the [updated Scenario Tool](scenario_tool.md), the new Results Viewer relies on `xlwings`. As with the Scenario Tool, 
you will find an `xlwings.conf` tab in the Results Viewer. The same instructions 
for {ref}`configuring xlwings<configure-xlwings>` applies to this spreadsheet. 

### Loading a Results Report

The `Dashboard` tab houses all the summarized results & summary charts. This tab has three buttons:
1. **Update Cases List:** Looks at the `reports` subfolder for RESOLVE results folders that can be loaded and updates 
the "Selected Cases to View" dropdown cell. 
2. **Load Summary Results:** Loads the selected case to be displayed in the Results Viewer.
3. **Copy Snapshot of Current Dashboard:** Saves a copy of the `Dashboard` tab with the current time as a 
timestamp.

Once the Results Viewer loads in the CSV results files, the tables on the `Dashboard` tab should be updated. 
An example of the summary charts is shown below:

Reported results include:
- System Costs
  - Non-Modeled Cost
  - Capital & Fixed Costs
  - Variable Costs
- System Build
  - Total Nameplate Capacity
  - Selected & Retired Nameplate Capacity
  - Baseline Nameplate Capacity

  - Selected Storage Energy
  - Selected Storage Duration
- System Dispatch
  - Annual Energy
  - Zonal Unserved Energy or Overgeneration
- Planning Reserve Margin & ELCCs
  - Achieved PRM
  - Target PRM
  - Marginal ELCC Metrics (CPUC IRP-specific)
- Emissions Target

- CAISO Transmission Deliverability Upgrades (CPUC IRP-specific)
  - Selected CAISO Transmission Deliverability Upgrades
  - Selected Upgrades as % of Potential
  - Selected Upgrade Costs
  - On-Peak Deliverability Constraints
  - Secondary Deliverability Constraints
  - Off-Peak Deliverability Constraints
  - CAISO Renewable Build by Location

### Configuring Results Reporting Groups

Results can be grouped in different ways by updating the tables on the `Results Grouping` tab, as shown in the screenshot below. 
![](../../_images/results-viewer-groupings.png)

**Zones to aggregate.** For the most part, formulas should be able to sum over multiple modeled zones. By default 
in the CPUC IRP case, the two zones to aggregate are `CAISO` and `CAISO_NW_Hydro`, but users should be able to toggle `SW`, 
for example.

**Names of results groups for different categories of results (e.g., system build).** For each category of results, 
This table assigns the unique reporting groups. For example, for results reporting using the "Build & Dispatch" groupings,  
users can expect that results groups such as `Nuclear`, `Coal`, etc. 
```{warning}
At this time, the table "indices" on the `Dashboard` tab do not automatically update should a user change, add, or 
remove unique results groups. Users will need to manually update the index names of each summary table.  
```

**Assignment of different resources to the results groups.** Given the unique results groupings, this table 
lists how each resource (or transmission path, etc.) is assigned to that grouping. As shown in the screenshot, 
users can expect that `Arizona_Li_Battery` and `CAISO_Baseline_Li_Battery` are both summed into the group called `Battery Storage` 
for tables on the `Dashboard` tab using the "Build & Dispatch` groupings. Those same resources may be grouped differently 
in a different summary table, depending on the groupings assigned in this table.

## Viewing Results via `System` API

The long-run goal of Resolve-based models is to leverage the object-oriented underpinnings to enable more 
consistent & flexible results reporting. At this time, results can be retrieved by a savvy user from the `ResolveCase` 
and `System` instances; however, the public API for doing so is a work in progress.
