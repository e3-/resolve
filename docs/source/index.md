# Resolve

Welcome to the new `Resolve` documentation! 

`Resolve` is a least-cost capacity expansion model that identifies optimal electricity supply portfolios through capacity 
expansion and production simulation modeling. Optimal investment plans account for the capital costs of new resources, 
the variable costs of reliably operating the grid, and additional values such as environmental attributes. 
`Resolve` has been used to support resource planning and valuation for dozens of clients across North America. 

`Resolve` was initially developed in 2014 to assess the investment needs of systems seeking to integrate large quantities of variable renewable 
resources. In 2020, `Resolve` was re-developed from the ground up to study emerging questions around emerging technologies
(e.g., long-duration energy storage, electrolytic fuel production) thanks to funding by the California Energy Commission
([CEC EPC-19-056](https://www.energizeinnovation.fund/projects/assessing-long-duration-energy-storage-deployment-scenarios-meet-californias-energy-goals)).
