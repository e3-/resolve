# Resolve


Welcome to the new `Resolve` documentation! 

`Resolve` is an electricity resource planning model that identifies optimal long-term electric generation and transmission 
investments subject to reliability, policy, and technical constraints.

Designed in 2014 to assess the investment needs of systems seeking to integrate large quantities of variable renewable 
resources, `Resolve` identifies optimal portfolios of renewable and conventional energy resources through capacity 
expansion and production simulation modeling. Optimal investment plans account for the capital costs of new resources, 
the variable costs of reliably operating the grid, and additional values such as environmental attributes. 
`Resolve` has been used to support resource planning and valuation for dozens of clients across North America.
