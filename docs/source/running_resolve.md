# Running `Resolve`

After saving your input data & case settings (as described in {ref}`saving-inputs`), you are now ready 
to run `Resolve`!

## Running `Resolve` from the Scenario Tool

As in previous versions of `Resolve`, users can run cases directly from the Scenario Tool. 
Below the "Run Resolve Cases" header on the right of that tab, you'll find a green "Run Resolve Cases Locally" 
button. 
- On Windows, this will create a new command line window, and you will see `Resolve` progress. 
- On macOS, we have not yet figured out how to show the command line window as `Resolve` is running. 
  For now, we recommend macOS users run `Resolve` from Terminal themselves, as described in the next section. 

## Running `Resolve` from Command Line

If you plan to run `Resolve` via a command line/terminal, use the following instructions. 
Running `Resolve` via the command line gives you more options for how the model is run than are exposed in the 
Scenario Tool, as discussed below.

1. In a command line (e.g., Command Prompt), navigate into the `./src/resolve/resolve` directory
2. Activate `resolve-env` conda environment: `conda activate resolve-env`
3. Use the command `python run_opt.py` to run a case. The `run_opt.py` script accepts the following arguments:
- `--data-folder`: The name of your data folder (if different than the default `.\data`)
- `--solver-name`: The name of the solver to use (e.g., `gurobi`, `cplex`, `amplxpress`, `appsi_highs`)
- `--raw-results`: Save all raw Pyomo model components as CSVs (for detailed model inspection).
- `--symbolic-solver-labels`: Enable descriptive variable names in the Pyomo model formulation--helpful for debugging.

Examples:
- Run all cases listed in `./data/settings/resolve/cases_to_run.csv`:
  ```
  python run_opt.py 
  ```
- To run a single case called `Core_25MMT`, type the name of the case into the command line:
  ```
  python run_opt.py Core_25MMT
  ```
- Run all cases from a different data folder called `data-new` (listed in `./data-new/settings/resolve/cases_to_run.csv`):
  ```
  python run_opt.py --data-folder data-new
  ```
- Run all cases using `cplex` as your solver:
  ```
  python run_opt.py --solver-name cplex
  ```


```{note}
Hint: If you're in your command line and unsure what arguments to pass to `run_opt.py`, use the command 
`python run_opt.py --help` to get help!
```
