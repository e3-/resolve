# 3. Define Case Settings

This page will discuss the various settings that can be toggled in a `Resolve` run. 
Most settings on the "Resolve Settings" tab are linked to pre-populated settings on the "Case List" tab.

CPUC IRP stakeholders will find case settings for all the cases posted on the CPUC website pre-populated 
on the "Case List" tab.

## Case Settings

(input_scenarios)=
##### Input Scenarios

See {ref}`scenario_tags` for discussion about how to input scenario tagged data for components & linkages. 

As discussed in {py:func}`resolve.common.component.Component.from_csv`, input scenario tags are prioritized 
based on the order of scenarios in the `Resolve` case. Scenarios listed toward the bottom of the scenario list are higher priority 
and more likely to override other data if data is tagged with a "lower priority" scenario tag. In the screenshot below, for example, 
data tagged with the `base` tag will the lowest priority, since it is the first tag in the scenario list. For any of the 
subsequent scenario tags (e.g., `2021_PSP_22_23_TPP_ITC_ext`), to the extent that there is data that is tagged with the higher 
priority scenario tag, that higher priority data will override any `base`-tagged data.

```
On the `Resolve` Settings tab, users will find an orange dropdown inputs menu to help ensure that input scenarios selected 
are based on scenario tags that already are defined on the respective component & linkage attribute tabs. 
In the first column, select the sheet on which to look up available scenario tags. Then, in the second column, the dropdown input 
should only present scenario tags that are already defined on the respective sheet of the Scenario Too.

##### Representative Period Settings

Toggle between pre-defined sets of sampled days saved in the Scenario Tool. See {ref}`timeseries-clustering for instructions on how to create new sampled days.

##### Financial & Temporal Settings

The model will now endogenously calculate the annual discount factors to use for each modeled year based on four pieces 
of information:
1. **Cost dollar year:** The dollar year that costs are input in & should be reported out in. In general, `Resolve` is designed 
to be in real dollars for a specific dollar year.
2. **Modeled years:** Which modeled years to include in the `Resolve` case.
3. **End effect years:** The number of years to extrapolate out the last modeled year. In other words, considering 20 years 
of end effects after 2045 would mean that the last model year's annual discount factor would represent the discounted cost 
of 2045-2064, assuming that the 2045 costs are representative of a steady-state future for all end effect years.
4. **Annual discount rate:** Real discount rate in each year
5. **Inter-period dynamics:** Include additional chronological information to allow `Resolve` to shift energy between days across the modeled weather years.

##### Solver Settings

For now, users must follow the pattern of `solver.[solver name].[solver option].[data type]` when setting the solver settings. 
For example, users wanting to set Gurobi's [`Method` setting](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/method.html) 
would need to enter `solver.gurobi.Method.int` and the corresponding value. 

## Custom Constraints

Custom constraints allow users to customize the functionality of `Resolve` by adding additional constraints 
without needing to change the code. These are defined on the "Custom Constraints" tab and saved to 
`./data/settings/resolve/[case name]/custom_constraints/`

:::{admonition} 2023 CPUC IRP {octicon}`zap`
For the CPUC IRP, custom constraints are used for various custom functionality:
- Resource deliverability (i.e., CAISO FCDS/EO designation) and accompanying CAISO transmission upgrades
- Connecting disaggregated build variables to aggregate operational resources (which allows `Resolve` to make granular
  investment decisions while reducing the model size needed to represent operations. 
- Group-level constraints (e.g., "Resolve must build 15 GW of offshore wind by 2045" but can select amongst the 4 candidate OSW resources.)
:::

To create custom constraints:
1. Create a "Custom Constraint Group" name of your choosing. These groups are toggled 
   on/off in the active case settings together, so group custom constraints accordingly.
2. Within each custom constraint group,

## Timeseries Clustering

{bdg-warning-line}`Advanced Topic` 

Users who want to create a new set of sampled days can do so using the included Jupyter notebook in `./notebooks/cluster.py`. 
This is a [Jupytext file](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io). Note that to run the timeseries clustering, you first must save a case and all 
relevant system & component data (as described in {ref}`saving-inputs`). 

To open this notebook:
1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the `./notebooks` subfolder
2. Activate the `resolve-env` environment using `conda activate resolve-env`
3. Open the notebook using the following commands, which will launch a new tab in your web browser:
  ```
  jupytext-config set-default-viewer
  jupyter lab cluster.py
  ```
  This will launch a window in your web browser that looks something like this:

4. Run the cells (using the {octicon}`play` button or by using `Shift + Enter` keyboard shortcut) (for Jupyter notebook basics, users can [start here](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/#running-cells)).
