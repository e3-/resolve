# 2. Configure a System

The "System" tab defines the energy system being modeled, which is composed of a list of various modeling components
(loads, resource, policies, etc.). This tab will have any pre-populated system configurations in the yellow table(s) 
to the right of the tab, and different systems are linked to the active case on the "`Resolve` Settings" tab.

If users add any new modeling components (e.g., load components with new names, resources with new names), they will 
need to make sure that these new components are added to either an existing or new system configuration by updating 
the system list.
