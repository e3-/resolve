## Saving Input Data & Case Settings

Users who want to run pre-existing cases can save all necessary inputs from the "Resolve Settings" tab of the Scenario Tool.

1. Save the `Component` input data (e.g., resource heat rates, etc.) using the "Save Component Data" button
2. Save the `System` configuration (i.e., the combination of loads, resources, etc. to model) using the "Save System Configuration" button
3. Save a single case (e.g., years to model, scenarios, etc.) by selecting a case name from the "Case Name" dropdown and pressing the "Save Case Settings" button
   - To the right side of the "Resolve Settings" tab, you can also save *multiple* cases out of the Scenario Tool:
