:::{card} Cost-Effectiveness
- What impact will plan have on customer costs?
- Does plan expose customers to excessive levels of risk?
:::
:::{card} Reliability & Resource Adequacy
- Does plan meet defined reliability standard (e.g., “1 day in 10 years”)?
- Does portfolio have sufficient operational flexibility?
:::
:::{card} Environmental Policy
- Does plan comply with additional regulatory requirements (e.g., energy efficiency standards, RPS targets)?
- What is the carbon footprint of electricity portfolio?
- How does plan impact criteria pollutants?
- How much water use is associated with generation?

## Best Practices

1. Incorporate climate policy & impacts of climate change into analysis & decisions 
2. Consider renewable and energy storage resources as candidate resources 
3. Use LOLP modeling to determine future capacity needs for resource adequacy 
4. Consider TRC benefits that can be provided by demand-side resources 
5. Assess operational flexibility needs through a detailed operational study 
6. Engage stakeholders in a robust, transparent process

## Co-existing with Other Modeling

- Economy-wide decarbonization scenarios
- Reliability (loss-of-load-probability) modeling
- Production simulation
- Power flow
